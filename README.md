Iris Classification using PCA & KNN

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on the Iris dataset.

Steps

Load dataset & perform basic EDA.

Standardize features with StandardScaler.

Apply PCA (reduce 4D → 2D) for visualization.

Train & test KNN on:

Original 4 features.

PCA-reduced 2 features.

Evaluate with Accuracy, Classification Report & Confusion Matrix.

Key Concepts

PCA: Reduces dimensions while keeping maximum variance.

KNN: Classifies based on nearest neighbors in feature space.

Results

KNN with 4 features → Higher accuracy.

KNN with 2 PCA features → Slightly lower accuracy but good visualization.
